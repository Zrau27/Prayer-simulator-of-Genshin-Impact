### Now I'll shortly talk about my code. ###
+ code language: python
+ UI : Qtdesigner 
+ I mainly used pyqt5 to design the software.
+ bottom_func.py contains a function that return the result of praying once -- a tuple (stars3/4/5 , characters_or_arms0/1 ,  random order)
Mainly "if" ,"elif","else"     XD

+ Data.py contains all names of characters and arms, and function for decoding the random order for each pool.

+ main_ui.py is the UI. 

+ GettingCard_v3.x.py is the main file. It realizes four main functions: praying once, praying ten times together, reset and display statistical results.
I used Qlabel to show gif , pictures and text, and threading.timer to support it.
Qlabel imba! XD
